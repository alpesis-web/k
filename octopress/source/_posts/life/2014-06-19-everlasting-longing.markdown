## 宋词：长相思

今读宋词，更多是一种情致，其平仄带来的语言的韵律美，就如一首歌。今读到的这首描写的是春光明媚，宛若江南景。

花深红，花浅红，桃杏浅深花不同。年年吹暖风。  
莺语中，燕语中，唤起碧窗春睡浓。日高花影重。  

这首词表现出来的春光无限与色彩斑斓，春鸟啾啾的画面活灵活现，脑中浮现，一片生气盎然。甚是喜爱。
它的是词牌名是《长相思》，双调三十六字，前后阕格式相同，各三平韵，一叠韵，一韵到底。其音韵如下：

仄仄平，仄仄平，平仄平平仄仄平，平平仄仄平。  
仄平平，仄平平，仄仄平平平仄平，中平中仄平。  

依照这样的音韵，再看看白居易的《长相思》：

汴水流，泗水流，流到瓜洲古渡头。吴山点点愁。  
思悠悠，恨悠悠，恨到归时方始休。月明人倚楼。  

这首词的色彩就暗淡了许多，点点离愁，闺怨涟涟，好生伤感。


## Song Ci: Everlasting Longing

When I read the Chinese Song Ci (one of the Chinese poems in Song
Dynastic), mostly, I could found it is one of the best ways to express the
feelings of life. When I read the Song Ci, the tunes of the words are like a
song. When I read it, I am singing.

Today, I read a beautiful Song Ci which is shown that the pretty landscape in
the spring, the florious flowers and the pretty cute singing birds. This
reminds me the landscape in the eastern China in the spring.

I tried to translate it like this:

See the blomming flowers are red  
And the glorious flowers are red  
The colour of peaches, the colour of apricot, the flowers are coloured bright  
The soft winds come every year  

The orioles are singing  
And the swallow are singing  
So thus, at the window, I have these songs in my dreams  
The sun rise in the shadow of the flowers  

The tune of this Song Ci is everlasting longing, dual tunes with 36 Chinese
characters, the first part are as the same as the second one. The tune is like
this:

ze ze ping, ze ze ping, ping ze ping ping ze ze ping, ping ping ze ze ping.  
ze ping ping, ze ping ping, ze ze ping ping ping ze ping, zhong ping zhong ze ping.  

Referred to this tune, let's read another Song Ci written by Bai Juyi (白居易),
and was translated by Xu Yuanchong (许渊冲) like this:

See the Bian River flow  
And the Si River flow  
By Ancient Ferry, mingling waves, they go  
The Southern hills reflect my woe  

My thought stretches endlessly  
My grief wretches endlessly  
So thus until my hudband comes to me  
Alone on moon-lit balcony  

I felt so sad when I read this poem, a girl was wating for her husband at
night, when she thought of her husband, her sorrow was like the flowing water
in the river, it was endless.
