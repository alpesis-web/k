## 药名联句


看着别人用中药名联句([相思续断半夏风])，也试了一试：

寒水石，  
忍冬待半夏。  
千里红花炼沉香，  
一枝玉竹筑仙茅。  
天冬何时了。  

药名：寒水石，忍冬，半夏，红花，沉香，玉竹，仙茅，天冬


## Composing Song Ci with Chinese Herbs

Someone composed [Song Ci with the names of Chinese Herbs][相思续断半夏风], then I had a try, just for fun:

With the white stone standing besides the iced water,  
It is waiting for the mid-summer in this winter.  
Using thousands of the red flowers to make a bottle of perfume,  
A pretty bamboo to build a maison in the paradise.  
When will be the end of this winter?
