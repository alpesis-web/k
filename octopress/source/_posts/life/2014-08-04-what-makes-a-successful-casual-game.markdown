Recently, I played both casual games: one is Circle the Cat which is the
simplified version of Chinese Go, another is Fluppy Bird which is like a game
we played in the childhold.

I found they have some common factors:

-- It is easy to play, users just need to tap tap tap.  
-- It is difficult to pass, it needs some strategies if the users want to pass the games.  
-- Both are modified from the traditional games.  

Because it is easy to play, users can play it at the leisure time; because it
is not easy to pass, it pushes the users to think about the strategies, and
then shared the scores with their friends, that makes the game popular.

In the contrast, as a developer, learns the strategies from the traditional games, designs the
cartoon images which please the users, and uses the users' languages, perhaps it
is one of the strategies when develop a casual game.


## 休闲游戏


近来玩了两款游戏，一个是在微信非常流行的《围住神经猫》，另一个是《Fluppy
Bird》，发现两者有着共同的特点：

-- 玩法简单，神经猫只需点点点，小鸟也是。  
-- 策略不简单，神经猫带着围棋的解法，小鸟需要时间习得平衡（时间、方向、重力）。  
-- 两者都是传统游戏的改良，带上了可爱的界面，可亲民。神经猫改自围棋，披上了神经猫的网络用语；小鸟像小时候玩的小球不能碰着旁边的铁圈，也像小时候玩的飞机，披上了可爱的小鸟造型，也让人联想起愤怒的小鸟这款游戏。  


因为玩法简单，用户可以在闲暇的时候玩；因为策略不简单，激起了用户挑战的心理，再加上晒成绩或有排行榜，更增添了游戏传播的可能性。

而作为开发者，把传统游戏修改为符合时代特征的语言和卡通形象，也是开发的一种思路吧。
